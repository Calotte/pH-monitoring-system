# pH-monitoring-system
The project is from Student’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Action Plan of Lanzhou University. 
After a deep understanding of the wireless sensor network, as well as the comparative analysis 
of various short-distance communication techniques, carefully studied the IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee 
protocol, then gives the design of soil pH monitoring system based on Zigbee. For 2.4-GHZ IEEE 
802.15.4、Zigbee and RF4CE, CC2530 is a true System-on-Chip(SoC) solutions. Based on CC2530 RF 
chip, this article designsed a data acquisition and wireless communication module of Sensor nodes, 
Routers and Coordinator, established working frequency 2.4GHz global wireless sensor network to 
undertake data collection and transmission. In Windows 8.1 with Updated1 pro and IAR environment, 
write and compile the sensor nodes, router and coordinator node program. Besides, through the contact 
and understanding of server, realized the real-time remote monitoring of the soil pH.
